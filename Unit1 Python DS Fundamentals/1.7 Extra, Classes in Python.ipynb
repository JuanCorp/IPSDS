    "While not completely necessary when it comes to Data Science (that is, until you get to machine learning), classes play a huge role in programming in general. Originating from Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), classes are a way to represent objects or abstract real life things into code. \n",

    "For example, as the image above suggests, you have an account, and an account holder. The account holder has a surname, penname, address, profession and birthday as attributes that describe them. An account, has its holder, the account number, the credit line, the current balance, and the holder of the right of disposal. These are called the **attributes** of the class.  \n",

    "At the same time, in the green area, we have actions like Deposit, Withdrawal, Transfer and Standing Order. There are the **methods** of the class, which are the actions that a class can perform. \n",
