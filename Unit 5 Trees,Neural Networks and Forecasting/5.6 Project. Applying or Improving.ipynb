    "In this unit, you've seen more advanced and robust models for predictive learning. Hopefully you've also picked up on some differences between them as well:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logistic/Linear regression are very interpretable. They give you the direction and magnitude a feature has towards prediction in the form of the model coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tree based models give you a good idea of which features are important for prediction, in the form of the splits.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Neural networks are very robust, but are more like black boxes. Data goes in, output goes out. Like in the example where the neural network would predict  0 or 1 based on which pixel was black at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So sometimes you have to make compromises on interpretability vs. robustness. Choosing the right model for your data isn't a straightforward process, even when knowing the math. Even if you are sure that X model would work really well for Y data, test out whatever you can! For this unit's project, you may do one of the following, or both:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Improve the previous implementations of the models we've seen so far (trees need some work for example!). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Apply the models learned on this chapter on datasets. See into Kaggle competitions, or the UCI machine learning repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html. Focusing mostly on the modeling part (cross validation, model selection, bias/variance tradeoff)\n",

    "Most of all, have fun! Pick topics that are of most interest to you, and see how far you can go."
