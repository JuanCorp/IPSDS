    "So after learning how to create and train a neural network on the last notebook, we successfully classified images between digits that are 0 or 1. In this notebook we'll go further beyond that, but we'll focus on two things: building a more general neural network class and applying some extra generalization and optimization functions for the network . We'll also use the full dataset for classifying handwritten digits, so the complexity is now greater! Let's first start with all the extra tidbits. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "Now before you go dropping this notebook, this is not about dropping the course. Dropout in neural networks is a process applied after the activation function where a proportion of results of the activation function are multiplied element-wise by a vector of the same size. This vector is the same size as the output of the activation function, and is filled with 1s and 0s. So after this multiplication, some of the results of the activation function are turned to 0 and others stay the same, essentially \"dropping\" some of the results. For example, if the dropout ratio was 0.5 then we would get:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $y = f(x) \\cdot m$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $y$ is the output of the neuron, $f(x)$ is the activation function and m is the dropout vector, which would be 50% (0.5 dropout ratio) filled with 0s and the rest filled with 1s. A fully connected (Linear) layer occupies most of the parameters and neurons develop co-dependency amongst each other during training which curbs the individual power of each neuron leading to over-fitting of training data. With dropout, this dependency is reduced by a large amount, since each training epoch generates a \"new\" neural network. During testing, the weights are simply multiplied by the dropout ratio, \"simulating\" the dropout while using all neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $z = p \\cdot Wy$ where p is the dropout ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "During backpropagation, we multiply the derivative of the activation function by the same dropout vector $m$, thus simulating the same dropout experienced in forward propagation during backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding Noise\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the point of ML models is to be able to generalize to unknown testing data, perturbing the inputs by a small bit can make the network more robust to unknown inputs. However, it's bad to just add random data that may even hinder our performance, although with images this isn't that huge of a problem as long as the noise is small. This noise is typically added to the input layer, before any calculations are made, where random noise is added to all the pixels of the image. This makes the network put more effort in training and generalizing across all inputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decaying learning rate \n",
    "\n",
    "If we use a validation set, and validate the network on each training epoch with the test data, we can get an overall score of how the model is improving. If we find that the model isn't improving after a certain number of epochs, we can make the learning rate smaller so that the model changes its weights at a slower rate, but gets closer to the minimum loss. We may choose to divide the learning rate by 2 or another number after a fixed number of epochs, or we wait until our validation accuracy isn't improving, and cut the learning rate there. If it doesn't improve after two decays, we can also implement **early stopping** where we stop the training of the neural network, since it's already done training. This speeds up the training procedure considerably.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimizations\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from Stochastic Gradient Descent, we can implement other variations of gradient descent based on SGD, like:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Momentum\n",
    "Momentum  is a method that helps accelerate SGD in the relevant direction and dampens oscillations. It does this by adding a fraction $\\gamma$ of the update vector of the past time step to the current update vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "$v_t = \\gamma v_{t-1} + \\alpha \\nabla_\\theta J(\\theta)  $ where $\\alpha$ is the learning rate, $\\nabla_\\theta J(\\theta)$ is the gradient of the parameters, and $\\gamma$ is the momentum fraction, usually started at 0.9\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nesterov Momentum\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a variation of momentum in which we subtract the velocity parameter $\\gamma v_{t-1}$ to the weights before calculating the gradient. This gives us a rough estimate of where the parameters are going ot be, and makes training more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "$v_t = \\gamma v_{t-1} + \\alpha \\nabla_\\theta J(\\theta - \\gamma v_{t-1})$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adagrad\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an optimization algorithm which uses an adaptive learning rate to update the parameters, by performing larger updates for infrequent parameters and smaller updates for frequent parameters. This is done by saving a history of the parameter updating or a \"cache\".\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\theta_{t+1} = \\theta_t  - \\dfrac{\\alpha}{\\sqrt{G_t + \\varepsilon}} * g_t$ where $G_t$ is the accumulation of the parameter update history, g_t is the gradient of the parameter and $\\varepsilon$ is an extremely small number like $ 10^{-8}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "### Adam\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a method keeps an exponentially decaying average of past gradients $m_t$ like momentum, while also keeping  an exponentially decaying average of past squared gradients $v_t$ (different $v$ than the one in momentum), where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$m_t = \\beta_1 m_{t-1} + (1 - \\beta_1)g_t$\n",
    "\n",
    "$v_t = \\beta_2 v_{t-1} + (1 - \\beta_2)g{_t}^2$ \n",
    "\n",
    "but these are biased towards 0, so to counteract them they are reprashed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hat{m_t} = \\dfrac{m_t}{1 - \\beta_{1}^t}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hat{v_t} = \\dfrac{v_t}{1 - \\beta_{2}^t}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\beta_1$ is initialized at 0.9 and $\\beta_2$ is initialized at 0.999. The final parameter updated is phrased:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\theta_t = \\theta_t - \\dfrac{\\alpha}{\\sqrt{\\hat{v_t}} + \\varepsilon} \\hat{m_t}$\n",
    "\n",
    "And mamy more optimizations, but we will leave them until this.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## More Generalized NN\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, let's build our more generalized neural network class. It should accept:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An indefinite amount of layers. This is done by having a list of layers and adding layers one by one. Then the forward and backward procedure is executed through each of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dividing Linear and activation layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Activation Layers must accept different activation functions and dropout. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Input layer can accept noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear Layers must accept different optimization functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's get to business. We'll first create the general network class."
