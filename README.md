The Interactive Data Science Summary in Python (WIP). 

These are a series of notebooks dedicated to learning Data Science concepts. These are mostly dedicated to those with some kind of
programming background, but anyone can start using them and start learning. These notebooks require Anaconda to be installed, so 
get that first if you're getting started. Each unit contains a capstone project and an extra optional class in the end, so for those 
itching for more, take a look at those as well. Most notebooks are comprised of various short theory + code snippets + exercises, some 
with long exercises in the end. Each notebook should take about an hour to go through, plus several more hours of reading + exercises.
The Units are as follows:

Unit 1: Python Basics for Data Science.

Unit 2: Data Extraction and Manipulation.

Unit 3: Data Visualization.

Unit 4: Introduction to Machine Learning.

Unit 5: Applied Machine Learning.

Unit 6: Advanced Machine Learning.(WIP)
