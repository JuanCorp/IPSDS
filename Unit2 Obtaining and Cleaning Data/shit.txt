1 shit Freedom or jail, clip's inserted, a baby's being born 
2 shit Same time a man is murdered, the beginning and end 
3 shit As far as rap go, it's only natural I explain 
4 shit My plateau, and also, what defines my name 
5 shit First it was Nasty, but times have changed 
6 shit Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my science for pain 
7 shit I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame 
8 shit Saw fiends shoot up and do lines of cocaine 
9 shit Saw my close friends shot, flatline am I sane? 
10 shit That depends, carry Mac-10's to practice my aim 
11 shit On rooftops, tape CD covers to trees 
12 shit Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze 
13 shit Street scriptures for lost souls, in the crossroads 
14 shit To the corner thugs hustling for cars that cost dough
