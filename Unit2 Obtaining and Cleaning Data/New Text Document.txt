Freedom or jail, clip's inserted, a baby's being born shit
Same time a man is murdered, the beginning and end shit
As far as rap go, it's only natural I explain shit
My plateau, and also, what defines my name shit
First it was Nasty, but times have changed shit
Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my science for pain shit
I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame shit
Saw fiends shoot up and do lines of cocaine shit
Saw my close friends shot, flatline am I sane? shit
That depends, carry Mac-10's to practice my aim shit
On rooftops, tape CD covers to trees shit
Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze shit
Street scriptures for lost souls, in the crossroads shit
To the corner thugs hustling for cars that cost dough shit
