    "In Data Science, **Feature Engineering** is the process of creating new features from existing features of a dataset. This is where you can really get creative with the data, since there are can be a lot of features hidden in a dataset, and some of them can improve the accuracy of the predictions that you later make with the data. Some frequent examples of features that be created from common data include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Current Date - Birth Date = Age\n",
    "- Date2 - Date1 = Days between. \n",
    "- Divided Full name = First Name, Surname\n",
    "- Divided date = Day, Month, Year\n",
    "\n",
    "And so on. The possibilities depend on your imagination and on the data that you are working with. Of course, you also have to determine how these extra features affect the performance of your model. Let's see this in action with the titanic dataset that we worked with previously."

    "In a nutshell, feature engineering is where you can let your imagination loose. When you have cleaned and dealt with missing data in a dataset, try to create new features with the data that you have. Sometimes, creative feature engineering is more powerful than fancy algorithms when creating a predictive model, so always work a lot with your data before moving forward!\n",

    "**Hint:** Try to minimize the Title feature, or taking only the numbers from a ticket. "
