    "One useful site for all aspiring and current data scientists is https://www.kaggle.com/, which contains a lot of useful stuff like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Competitions: where you are presented with a problem, data related to it and are tasked to build a model that tops all others! Competitions are great for learning (and even to put in a CV!), so I highly recommend them. But don't get too addicted to them, it's better to be good at ML than good at Kaggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Datasets: There's a huge amount of varied datasets, a lot of them are even user uploaded! So if are looking for data to start a project, or just want to run an analysis, kaggle is also great.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Kernels: You could be running this jupyter notebook over there on kaggle! They have notebooks and regular script pages running with a huge amount of Data Science and Machine Learning libraries, which are great if you are stuck at work (unless the firewall blocks you).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Community: There's a huge community of friendly and helpful users, and a lot of them share their knowledge, best practices and procedures here.\n",
